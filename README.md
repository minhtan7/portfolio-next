## Full Stack Developer

### Introduction

Hello! I'm Tan Vo, a diligent and adaptable software developer with a unique background as a former medical doctor. Now pursuing my degree at <a href='https://maynoothuniversity.ie/' target="_blank">Maynooth University</a>, I am eager to make a meaningful impact on projects and improve people's lives. With a year of experience as a Full Stack Web Developer at start-up company <a href="https://www.medlangfanatic.com" target="_blank">Med Lang Fanatic</a>, I've played a pivotal role in both development and business decision-making, where I was the solo developer for a project.

Concurrently, I've accumulated one year of experience as a coding instructor in a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at <a href="https://www.coderschool.vn/en" target="_blank">Coderschool</a>, where I showcased my strong technical and soft skills, such as effective debugging, problem-solving, and collaboration. My passion for continuous learning and a keen interest in working on large-scale, high-performance projects drive my career objective to join a company that offers challenging opportunities to enhance my skills and contribute to its success.

With a diverse background, technical expertise, and collaboration, I am an ideal candidate for roles requiring working with many people on high-performance projects. I welcome new opportunities, learning experiences, and networking with professionals in the tech industry.
